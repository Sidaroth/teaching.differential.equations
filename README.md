# Titanium
Codename Titanium - Serious Game supplementing higher level mathematical education.

## Preliminary Research and Planning
A detailed project plan for the master thesis can be seen and read in "Detailed Project plan.pdf". This report was written for the class on "Research Project Planning" at NTNU in Gjøvik, and describes the plan of action for this project for the next 6 months or so.

To validate our design decisions and get feedback from target audience members, we ran a preliminary user test on one prototype case from the serious game. The results can be seen in "Preliminary Project Report.pdf". This report was written for the class on "Advanced Project Work" at NTNU in Gjøvik. 

## Work in Progress - Research Projects
This project is intended to be used as the development part of two research & development projects at NTNU in Gjøvik, Norway.
Specifically for advanced project work, and my Master's Thesis. 

## External Assets used
- Unreal Starter Content
